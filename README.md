# SWADS-440IPC controller

I hate this camera.

Dependencies:
    platform, sys, math, xinput-python, time, keyboard, opencv-python, requests

just `pip install` them.

## Installation

```text
cd <wherever you want>
git clone https://github.m/nachocheese989/IPCControl
```

That's it. No installation needed.
You can access it by putting the IPControl.py path in you PYTHONPATH env variable, or by putting the IPCControl directory in you project directory, then importing it as ```python import IPCControl.IPConrol```
