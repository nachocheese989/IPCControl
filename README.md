# SWADS-440IPC controller

I hate this camera.

Dependencies:
    platform, sys, math, xinput-python, time, keyboard, opencv-python, requests

just `pip install` them.

## Installation

    ```text
    cd <where its going>
    git clone https://github.m/nachocheese989/IPCControl
    ```

    That's it.
    You can access it by putting the IPControl.py path in you PYTHONPATH env variable and importing it as ```python import IPCControl```.
    More simply you can the IPCControl directory in you project directory, then importing it as ```python import IPCControl.IPCConrol```

## Usage

    The docs in the python files explain it. run IPCControl.py, changing the url to your cameras ip for an example function.
